A quick online search leads you to a Dr. Henri Dubois, professor of archaeology at the National School of Anthropology and History in Mexico City.\n\nDr. Dubois led the dig team that discovered the underground temple where La Norde was housed. By all accounts, it was Dr. Dubois' life work - he had been searching for the lost temple for decades. He was ecstatic when the dig finally uncovered the crumbling ruins and strange idols within.\n\nHowever, since La Norde's move to the museum, Dr. Dubois has been uncharacteristically silent. He declined all requests for interviews and comment. His peers describe his behavior as \"odd\" and \"concerning.\"\n\nPerhaps the good doctor knows more than he is letting on? Should you reach out to him directly?\n\n```\n1. Book a flight to Mexico City to try and meet with Dr. Dubois in person.\n2. Call Dr. Dubois and politely ask for any information he may have on La Norde's origins and history.\n3. Research past archaeological digs led by Dr. Dubois - is there a pattern to what he uncovers?\n4. Decide Dr. Dubois is a dead end for now and investigate the museum further.\n```"

The eyes peer up like a curious child before a soft song bubbles up from the water.\r\n\r\nReports say that nobody knows how the song goes, as the poor saps who listen enter a trance state and end up drowning. The reported missing bodies have never been recovered. However, it's become too much for this part of Quebec, with over 29 lives lost to this supposed creature in the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nDetective Reed already supplied your case with the basics: a case file, what minimal witness testimony he could scrounge up, a flashlight, your trusty revolver, all the paid time to investigate this case... And a bottle of hard scotch.\r\n\r\nIt's time to give those poor Canucks a break from death... What will you do first?\r\n\r\n```\r\n1: Go through the case file.\r\n2: Talk to Detective Reed.\r\n3: Look for any extra information in other case files. Look for similarities.\r\n4: Head to Lullaby Lake.\r\n```",
